Two new stations have been introduced to the game; they are named "Loop" and "Gate.". Loop is a medium population map focused around a centralized security and medical department, with wide open hallways and an easy-to-navigate layout. Gate is a very complex map focused around gateways and shuttles as the primary method to get between departments. Each department is segmented far away from each other in space, with thin arms connecting them all together. Holopads have been added, allowing for remote calls between departments or the AI to have a physical interaction and local chats wherever the holopads may be. Atmospheric network computers allow for atmos techs to check the entire pipe network on the station, making it even easier to monitor gases and potential sabotage and damage.
